# Recipe Page

This project is a simple web page presenting a recipe for a classic dish.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The structure and content of the webpage are built using HTML5, ensuring semantic markup for better accessibility and search engine optimization.

- **CSS (w3.css)**: Styling is applied using the w3.css framework from W3Schools, providing a clean and responsive design with predefined classes for easy styling.

### Dynamic Theme Selection
In this project, we've implemented a feature that dynamically selects a theme for the webpage every time it loads or refreshes. This adds variety and visual interest to the user experience.
